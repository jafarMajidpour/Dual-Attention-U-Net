Dual Attention U-Net for Breast Tumor Ultrasound Segmentation
Breast ultrasound tumor segmentation faces critical challenges, including severe class imbalance between small tumor regions and dominant background pixels, poor boundary delineation caused by speckle noise and low contrast, and limited generalization across different ultrasound scanners due to training on small domain-specific datasets. To address the challenges, this paper proposes a novel U-Net architecture with pre-trained EfficientNet-B4 encoder for robust breast ultrasound tumor segmentation. The model leverages transfer learning (TL) from ImageNet-1K to extract hierarchical multi-scale features through four strategic skip connections at encoder indices [2, 3, 5, 8], capturing 32 to 1,792 channels at progressively deeper resolutions. A custom decoder with four upsampling stages reconstructs spatial details through bilinear interpolation and skip connection integration. We implement differential learning rates (encoder: 5×10⁻⁶, decoder: 5×10⁻⁵) for optimal fine-tuning, a hybrid Focal-Dice loss function addressing class imbalance and boundary precision, and comprehensive data augmentation with AdamW optimization. Extensive evaluation on BUSI and Dataset B demonstrates superior performance: 90.21±1.31% dice and 82.59±2.08% IoU on BUSI, and 93.09±2.39% dice and 87.09±2.69% IoU on Dataset B, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 7.49-11.65 percentage points. The model achieves exceptional cross-dataset generalization with 27.2M parameters, validating practical deployment viability for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems.
